Mastering Haskell
===

This repository holds the slides for my upcoming video course, "Mastering Haskell", published by Packt.

The slides for each video are in individual branches, one commit per slide.

The slides were created using [git-slides](https://github.com/gelisam/git-slides), and that tool is useful to navigate the slides as well, but not strictly required, you can simply navigate through the history using git commands.

Note that modifying slides is implemented by modifying the history, so unlike with most git repositories, it's easier to get the latest version by cloning the entire repository anew than by trying to pull the latest changes and dealing with the bifurcated histories.
